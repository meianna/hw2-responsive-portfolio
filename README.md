# Responsive Portfolio

This second homework assignment was to create a responsive portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework.

# Motivation

I created this portfolio to be responsive and work on a variety of screen sizes. The CSS is all Bootstrap. I wanted a bright minimalistic layout with a simple design. My portfolio includes:

* Navbar
* Responsive layout
* Responsive images
* Work samples with screen shots
* Link to a Scratch game
* Links to social media and email
